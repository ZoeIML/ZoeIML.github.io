    <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
        <p>
            They are essentially the same thing in that they have similar benefits and pracitcal aspects. Self-awareness is linked to mindfulness in that the latter will increase it.
        </p>
    <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
        <p>
            I tried the body scan. I listened to a similar exercise in order to make it easier, so that I wasn't constantly stopping to read the book. I felt more focused that during the usual mindfulness practices because I had something to focus on.  
        </p>
    <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
        <p>
            It seemed really liberating and like a good epiphany to aim for.
