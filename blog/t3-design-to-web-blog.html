    <h3>What is a responsive site, and why is it important?</h3>
        <p> 
        A responsive site changes according to the size of the screen it is being viewed on. It is important because it ensures all users have a positive experience interacting with the website. 
        </p>
    <h3> What is mobile first design is, and why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
        Mobile first design is important because it focuses on mobile or small screens first and then builds up. This means the mobile site is as enhanced as possible for small devices, which is important because of the number of users who are now viewing sites on smaller devices such as phones.
        </p>
    <h3>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h3>
        <p>
        A framework is standardised code used to support website development. They tend to address specific issues, such as layout. The pros include efficiency and support. The cons of frameworks include learning the framework rather than the language and limitations to the core behaviour of the framework.

    <h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use them?</h3>
        <p>
            A wireframe is a visual representation of elements on a webpage. We use them as blueprints for websites, which allow us to simplify communication and create a hierarchy of information.
        </p>
    <h3>My Wireframe:</h3>

    <h3>What aspects of your wireframes did you find hard to implement and why?</h3>
        <p>
            I found it hard to get the hand of Skeleton and the grid so most of my time was spent trying to work out how to position things. I think I made my design too complex and so I simplified part way through. I found it difficult to move between the Skeleton framework, HTML and CSS but felt like I kind of got there in the end.
