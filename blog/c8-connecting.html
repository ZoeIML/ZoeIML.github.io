    <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, and I found that starting with a conversation that just aims to 'get to know each other' is very helpful and provides a good foundation.
        </p>
    <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
        <p>
            I used empathic listening with a friend who was facing a a difficult situation at work, Bringing feelings into the conversation made out dicussion a lot more robust and it seemed like we covered more ground on what was going on and what might be helpful.
        </p>
    <h3>How did you find the loving kindess meditation?</h3>
        <p>
            Calming. I also tried the traditional method, and found that when I came to thinking about a difficult person I was a lot less frustrated and found it easier to be calm in my thoughts towards them.
        </p>
    <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing:</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> I decided to take a year off after three years of working and travel. This caused some conflict with my friend, who felt that I was throwing a career away and wasting time / money.</p>
        <p><strong>My perspective:</strong> I’m burnt out after three years working as a social worker. I know it’s not what I want to do but at the same time I have no idea what the alternatives are. I do know that I want to see the world, and that now is the best time for me to do that. This is my opportunity to learn about the world, other people and other places, and I want to seize it. I’m excited about the future for the first time in three years because it doesn’t involve continuing in this never-ending stressful cycle. </p>
        <p><strong>My friend's perspective:</strong> Zoe has been lucky enough to have a great start to her career and now she is throwing it away. She doesn’t have a set plan on where she is going or when she will be back, and she’s going alone which could be dangerous. She worked so hard at university and on her placements, landed a great start in the social work sphere and now she’s leaving it behind. She only has a vague idea of what she wants to see or what she wants to do which means she’s probably going to waste time and all of her money.</p>

    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
        <p> 
            I think disagreements like the above can also stem from the very different emotional places we come from. We have different priorities but we also can't be in someone else's shoes completely - that's why we have to listen and ask questions, trying to gain insight. Most of the time, I've found, when I do that I can see where the other person is coming from even if I have a different perspective or don't really agree.
