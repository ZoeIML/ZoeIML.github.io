    <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>

    <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
        <p>
            A control flow is the like the steps you need to wash the dishes, a checklist of tasks that allow you to finish washing them. A loop is like repeating those steps after each meal.

    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
        <p>
            You access data within an array by using an index number. You access data within an object by using a name. 
        </p>
    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
        <p>
            Functions are a block of code that perform a task when they are called. They are useful because you can reuse the code as much as you need to, in order to produce different (or similar) results.
