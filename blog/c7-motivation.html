    <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
        <p>
            More positive! I think society places a lot of emphasis on the pleasure aspect, which can make you feel like you're missing out or not living well if you don't feel super-extremely happy all the time. Life isn't about reaching and end goal of happiness because even if we got everything we wanted, we would still want more. That's why it's more important to focus on the journey. 
        </p>
    <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</h3>
        <h4>What are your core values?</h4>
            <ul class="minilist">
                <li><i>Being connected:</i> People are the most important part of my life, and the connections I have with friends and family are what I value the most. To me, being connected also means knowing what is happening in the world and being interested in what is happening for others, whether good or bad.</li>
                <li><i>Kindness:</i> Kindness from others is something I could not be without, and I want to always be working on kindness and my attitude towards others.</li>
                <li><i>Openness:</i> Being open to new experiences, understanding the experiences of others, and also being honest.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>What do you stand for?</h4>
            <ul class="minilist">
                <li><i>Learning:</i> I want to always be learning. About people, about history, about the world. And also learning new skills. There's so much to take in and I want to take in as much as possible.</li>
                <li><i>Hope:</i> Nothing is hopeless. In even the most dire situations there is light to be found (sometimes very, very, very deep down).</li>
                <li><i>Courage:</i> Be fearless in exploring the world and in learning. Sometimes, asking someone about their experience and being open to believing them is a scary thing but it's so important.</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
            <p>
                Familiar to some of the training I have done in the past. Paying attention to what's happening in your body is really grounding, which helps with rational reflection. 
            </p>
    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
            <p>
                I liked the idea that it's normal to feel stupid at times. Definitely been there!
