    <h1>Time and Management Reflections</h1>
    <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
    <p> 
        I tried the Pomodoro technique for a writing task, as well as trying the Fogg Method to introduce new habits around self-care. 
        It's early days with the latter yet. I already use mindfulness / meditation during the day. 
    </p>
    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
    <p>
        For me, the most interesting point was the idea that behaviour should come before motivation before motivation is not enough to estabish a new habit. 
        I liked the idea of getting back to basics and starting small, building up to a habit and letting go of the "thinking big" which is something that is easy to focus on instead.
    </p>
    <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
    <p>
       I liked the Pomodoro technique for the task I was completing. It's a little early to tell about the habits but so far, so good. 
       Timeboxing is very similar to a different technique one of my workplaces had a few years ago, and it was pretty effective for me then.
    </p>
    <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
    <p> 
        I think I need to continue with developing the tiny habits and also to practiec the Pomodoro technique more because I found it pretty challenging to concentrate for 25 minutes straight!
