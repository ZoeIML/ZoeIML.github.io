    <h3> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
        <p>
            My main triggers are not knowing how to start in the first place when I read an instruction and when I struggle to understand concepts. I feel like I'm never going to get there and feel like I'm not smart enough to code.

    <h3> How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
        <p>
            I found it quite confronting but in a good way. It was hard to go back into the situation I chose but kind of interesting to be an observer in my own experience. For respond, I also think a valuable strategy is to "act opposite" to how you are feeling. For example, if your body temperature is increasing (usually anger) then try to cool down. Feel like crying? Try to smile slightly each time you breathe in - your emotions take cues from your body as well. I like how this exercise allows for your own personal touch.
