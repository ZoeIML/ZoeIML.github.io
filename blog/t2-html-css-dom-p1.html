    <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to a non-technical friend?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HMTL</b> is like the physical elements of a boardgame: cards, board, dice, etc. </li>
            <li><b>CSS</b> is like the design / look of the game: colours, themes, images, etc. </li>
            <li><b>DOM</b> is like the rule book for a boardgame in that it tells you how to interpret the elements of it in order to be able to play. </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
    <p>
        Dividing the elements of the webpage design into boxes. 
        The page is like a big box that houses all of the smaller ones. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
    <p>
        The box model helps with understand what a single box on the webpage contains in terms of format.
        The four parts, starting from the middle and working outwards, are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Content:</b> The nucleus of the box, which is surrounded by the other parts</li>
            <li><b>Padding:</b> The area around the content that directly protects it </li>
            <li><b>Border:</b> The space around the content and padding</li>
            <li><b>Margin:</b> The transparent space around all of the above, which is essentially the space between a box and other boxes on the page</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>My Wishlist</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Social media buttons</li>
        <li>A banner/photo element at the top of the page</li>
