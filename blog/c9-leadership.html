    <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
        <p>
            I haven't really experienced compassionate leadership, especially in professional settings. My experiences of leadership have been in highly stressful, emotionally intense environments where nurturing team members took last place, and instead there was a heavy focus on KPIs, meeting demand and putting your own needs first.

    <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
        <p>
            It was a new experience for me. I did enjoy picturing goodness as light, although the light I pictured was blue because I need colour to keep me focused.

    <h3> Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
        <p>
            This is similar to some of the anxiety mindfulness I used to do with clients, except it goes one step further by examining the pain of others. I found it intense but ultimately rewarding. We can spend a lot of time avoiding pain (which limits what we are willing to try, as the author notes) and also avoiding the acknowledgement of pain in our lives. That leads us to also avoid addressing other
            people's pain, because pain is a difficult thing to sit with. Tonglen meditation seems like a useful, safe way of acknowledging pain and working through it in life.

    <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
            I think that status, certainty and autonomy have played a particularly big role in Phase 0 for me. In terms of status, gaining some mastery and confidence has definitely been a boost. I don't feel particularly certain of my skills but I do feel certain that I want to code for a living, which is great. And there's a lot of autonomy involved since it's self-paced. Relatedness and fairness 
            haven't played much of a part in Phase 0. However, I suspect they will play a significant role at bootcamp. I think the elements of SCARF have different weights depending on the situation.

    <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h3>
        <p>
            I really valued the idea of impact being different from intention, and that we tend to judge others based on the former and ourselves on the latter. I also think that knowing the other person has identity factors at play is an important part of a successful difficult conversation and also just in building empathy in general.
