    <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p>
            I was particularly interested in the links between emotional intelligence and performance in the workplace. I used to work in mental health so a lot of the ideas are familiar to me but using them in a business context is a new concept.

    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>
        I enjoy mindfulness. Like most things that need practice, I know it takes time to build up that ability to really focus and I'm out of practice but I'm excited to be starting out again. I tend to prefer more active mindfulness activites like colouring in but the breathing is okay for me as well. I just need to remember not to judge myself when my mind wanders!
