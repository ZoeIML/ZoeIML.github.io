    <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
        <p>
            The process was very similar to social work! Social work has different terms for the techniques involved but the principles are the same. I learnt that I could benefit from applying those skills in everyday life. My sister said she felt listened to. 
        </p>
    <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
        <p>
            I liked the idea of having a buddy, and I happen to have a flatmate who has just been on a mindfulness course so we decided to try it out together. I also liked the idea of doing less than you can - I've used a similar process for exercise before and have found it works well for me.
