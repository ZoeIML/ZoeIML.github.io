    <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem and solved it in an elegant way:</h3>
        <ol class="minilist">
            <li><strong>The problem:</strong> I was stuck on an exercise where I was meant to have the programme count the number of blue, green or invisible dots in a noughts-and-crosses style game. </li>
            <li><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong> I read the code out to myself, step-by-step, including all of the syntax. I thought I had the code structure right but that I had probably made an error somewhere. </li>
            <li><strong>How did you feel throughout the proccess?</strong> Pretty frustrated! It took a couple of read-throughs for me to find two typos and once I fixed them things worked as planned. </li>
            <li><strong>What did you learn?</strong> To slow down a little when writing the code but also to take a breath and focus when I get stuck. If I had patiently read the code out from the start instead of getting annoyed, I would have solved it more quickly.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the following problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
        <ul class="minilist">
            <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I often feel confident when I read the pseudocode but then I get a little lost translating it into actual code.</li>
            <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> This is my favourite - change something and see what happens. Even if something goes wrong, it helps me to know I've actually done something and gives me something to work from.</li>
            <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I read out code and talk to myself all the time. I don't have an actual rubber duck but it's basically the same process. I guess I talk to my cup of tea.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Honestly, I find the error messages hard to understand most of the time but sometimes they help.</li>
            <li><strong>Console logging:</strong> It took me a while to get how console logging worked but once I got there I found it quite helpful. This is one I should use more, I think.</li>
            <li><strong>Googling:</strong> At some points during this sprint I was pretty much Googling everything. I love Google!</li>
            <li><strong>Asking peers for help:</strong> I'm not very good at reaching out for help, this is something I need to work on. This sprint, I found that I resolved things okay on my own but I'd like to feel more confident about reaching out as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> As above.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> I enjoy reflection and feel confident with it (although it's all a learning process, all the time!).</li>

        </ul>
