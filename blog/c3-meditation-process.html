    <h3>How did the "process over product" concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>
            It made me focus on different things from the beginning. At times, I got frustrated with certain aspects I wasn't managing to incorporate and it was helpful to come back to "process over product"at those times.
        </p>
    <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter two?</h3>
        <p>
            I used to take mindfulness sessions / classes with teenagers and children, which was generally a fun and helpful way of addressing things like anxiety, distress and sadness. I thought of meditation as a helpful tool to manage emotions, and as a valuable coping strategy.
        </p>
    <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
        <p>
            I found the attentional blink aspect very interesting as I tend to associate meditation and mindfulness with anxiety management and/or distress tolerance. It was a perspective shift to consider that meditation can be helpful for everyone in any situation.
        </p>
    <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
        <p>
            I think the main thing that I need to focus on is making time each day for meditation. Consistent practice, even if in short bursts, is the concept I want to take away from my reading.
        </p>
    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes sitting and breathing just doesn't suit us. If doesn't gel with you on a particular day, or even ever, there are loads of other ways to meditate and be mindful that are perhaps more active than sitting and breathing.
