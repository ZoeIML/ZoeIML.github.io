<h1>Reflections</h1>
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p> 
        So far, I'm excited to be part of such an in-depth learning experience. 
        It already feels like the start of a journey as opposed to just the start of a course. 
    </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
        I love the idea of being in the kitchen and becoming a creator. 
        It's already such a different way of thinking about learning.
    </p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>
        I think I have a tendency to have a restaurant attitude so I want to actively engage with a kitchen attitude instead. 
    </p>
    <h3>Have your expectations changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>Yes. I'm already seeing how this is more than just a cookie-cutter or "restaurant" course, which makes me really happy. 
    </p>
    <h3>Are your excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Nervous?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm both! It's all new and it's the start of a completely different adventure for me, so I feel excited <i>and</i> nervous most of the time.
    </p>
